# Disguised Unemployment in Blockchain? Data Shows Only 12% of Ethereum, 25% of Solana Protocols Have Revenue
## A large number of protocols on the two chains haven't captured any value lately, in what looks like on-chain version of disguised unemployment.

#### What to know: 
  * Disguised unemployment in blockchain is represented by a situation where many protocols exist but do not generate revenue.
  * On Ethereum, 88% of its 1,271 protocols have not generated revenue in the past 30 days, while Solana sees 75% of its 264 protocols inactive.
  * Inactive smart contracts increase storage burdens, security risks, and economic inefficiency, hindering the overall user experience.


Have you heard of disguised unemployment? It refers to a situation where a portion of the workforce appears to be employed, but isn't contributing to the economy's output. Consider the massive capital expenditure loss from ghost cities, which represent unoccupied infrastructure.
Something similar can be said for the top smart contract blockchains, which hosts hundreds of decentralized protocols. Of these, only a minority are generating revenue, while the rest produce no yield, loosely representing ghost digital cities and a form of disguised unemployment.

[According to DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum), Ethereum is the world's largest smart contract blockchain, hosting 1,271 protocols. Yet over the past 30 days, a staggering 88%, or 1,121 projects in total, generated no revenue.
Ethereum's rival, Solana, has a much [smaller ecosystem](https://defillama.com/chain/solana), hosting 264 protocols, of which 75% have not generated revenue in the past few days.
In other words, a large number of protocols on the two chains haven't captured any value lately, much like the workforce that draws a salary but does not contribute to the output, or ghost towns that are not being utilized to generate a meaningful economic return.
## **Key AI insights**
Inactive projects are not necessarily a direct burden on the network's processing power in the same way that a congested network is, but they do pose an indirect burden in the following ways:
**Storage Burden**
Every smart contract, active or not, is stored on the blockchain forever. This immutable data adds to the size of the blockchain, and all nodes in the network must store and maintain this history. As the total number of contracts grows, so do the storage and bandwidth requirements for running a node. While the effect of a single inactive contract is minimal, a "ghost town" of thousands of them adds up over time, increasing the network's long-term operational costs.
**Security and Vulnerability Risks**
The existence of a vast number of inactive or abandoned contracts creates a larger attack surface. A smart contract, even if it's no longer used, can contain a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have unforeseen consequences for other parts of the ecosystem or funds locked within it. This introduces a layer of systemic risk to the network that must be continually monitored by security researchers and auditors.
**Economic Inefficiency**
This is where the "disguised unemployment" analogy is most apt. While these projects aren't causing congestion, they represent a collective failure of capital and developer time to create a productive asset on the network. The funds, time, and effort spent to deploy these projects are effectively locked in a non-productive state, which is a drag on the overall efficiency of the ecosystem.
Just as a physical ghost city represents a massive investment of capital and labour that yields no economic return, the multitude of non-revenue-generating protocols on blockchains represents wasted developer effort and capital that does not contribute to the network's productivity.
**Hindrance to User Experience**
A large number of inactive projects can make it difficult for new users to find and trust legitimate, active protocols. Sifting through a sea of defunct or failed projects can be confusing and might detract from the overall user experience.

BTC’s implied volatility jumps from 33 to 37 after hitting multi-year lows, raising the odds of a bigger market move ahead.
What to know: 
  * DVOL index spikes to 37, up from last week’s 26% low, historically a precursor to sharp price swings.
  * Spot-driven weekend rally from $116,000 to $122,000 suggests underlying strength as open interest trends lower.

# Fake It Till You Make It: Blockchain Apps Aren't Actually Decentralized
### I've been deep in the crypto rabbit hole... between the massive IPOs, projects raising quarter-billion rounds, and an idea that's been keeping me up at night.

If you’ve never played around with crypto…. a lot of these terms will confuse you. I’ll do my best to provide links if you’re interested in diving in to any of the things I mention.
Lately I have been playing around with crypto again. Back in 2015 I started mining ethereum and gave up too early. I never got into building smart contracts and actual decentralized apps, but I may be making a small one soon, just to learn.
As I was catching up on many different things, I started to realize just how centralized all the big “DeFi” apps really are. I’m shocked there isn’t more being done here to make some of them truly on-chain completely, or at least more agnostic in letting users control off chain actions affecting these applications.
It’s just unfortunate many users think what they’re using is either untrackable, or fully decentralized.
# Uniswap
It’s a great idea, a decentralized crypto exchange. The problem starts immediately though. 
There has to be some way to know the current exchange rates offered by the platform and also other exchanges. 
When you load the site, it makes graphql requests to their own *centralized* server in order to get information.
You also see many calls that track your every move:
Here’s one sending all of my device info with every action taking place.
Feels a lot like a normal website to me. And an invasive one at that…
At least they are [hosting it on IPFS](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-interface-ipfs), which is a distributed website hosting spec. It’s acutally really neat too. The problem I see though is its oracle outreach from the interface for pricing. 
I haven’t had enough time to config if their interface will still allow smart contract execution if one of their oracle systems is down.
Let’s take a look at another one!
# Polymarket
Alright, neat. Inspecting the page, I see direct calls to the blockchain. Decentralized right?
Well… sort of. These calls are sent to [alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/node-api-overview), a blockchain services provider. What happens if they do a deployment and mess up their node, suddenly polymarket is down (most likely anyway)

I was wondering, why don’t these services attempt to direct connect to various validators?
> P.S. I am not an expert AT ALL in this space, just someone interested in trying to make a fully, truly, decentralized app soon, and finding a lot of issues with current products.
Granted, they may not market themselves as fully decentralized, but I’m sure that’s how most people perceive them.
So I asked Claude, can’t I direct connect to a validator? Not always. 
It makes sense, most don’t want to run the rpc endpoints, because it will use a lot more resources, and these validators already require a massive amount of compute.
There are just so many points of failure, but for something like polymarket, you must have off chain systems that confirm what the result of the different markets are.
This puts all the trust in a platform that has already had legal battles in the past. I’d be worried about betting on something many months away.
# True Decentralization
Let’s start with just polymarket. It could be better if they offered a download link of their frontend application…. Oh wait, they’re using server side nextjs…. so they can’t. IPFS is perfect for client side websites that connect to the blockchain, because IPFS can only handle static files.
## Validator Choices
I would expect these types of apps to have a settings toggle that lets you put in a different validator endpoint. If one is down, you can swap, this would be a great option to have. Otherwise you’re connecting to a single point that may proxy behind the scenes, or it could have an outage at any time with no way to use the application.
If they don’t want to go that far, at least an internal list of validators to loop through if there was a connection problem.
I’d rather be able to do this, vs having to store every smart contract address and know the exact arguments to call in case I need to withdraw or perform other actions during a site issue.
# Downloadable
If their domain is seized, you’re already pretty screwed, unless you have saved network logs and know what rpc calls to make to see anything on the system.
This is step 1 of decentralizing these apps, at a bare minimum, I believe they should be html and js frontends, that are downloadable and run outside of their company’s domains.
AAVE, and Uniswap are good at this, although as I mentioned prior, still concerning how many 3rd party api endpoints are called from these frontends. Leaving me to wonder if they will work if certain things break.
# Open Source Consensus
Imagine Polymarket showing who the market validator is. In this case, it’s always polymarket. Let the community pay in crypto to be listed as a validator, track if they’re grading outcomes correctly, and let members decide who gets to validate their bets.
This has a lot of possible problems, but ultimately you need to trust someone. I’m suggesting to let users choose who to trust and make it uncontrollable by a single entity.
# Failsafes
If I chose to let polymarket grade my bet, and pick the outcome after the event happened, and polymarket gets shutdown. There should be a smart contract I can execute that will refund me after the end date of the market. This would provide relief if the platform is shut down.
When I use something on a blockchain, I want to know if everything goes bad (except for actual nodes all being taken offline) I want to know what I am interacting with is still safe.
## Wallet functionality
Wallets need to be able to ingest smart contract calls. I should be able to add th contract above (refunding after market issues), to my wallet, letting me interact with contracts in case the domains are no longer available, or I forget about them later.
I shouldn’t have to review the code myself.
# No tracking
Stop tracking usage, and build in your economics through transaction fees on the platform. Build everything you can into your smart contract, so you don’t need a graphql endpoint to do half the work…
# Wrap up
Hope you enjoyed these ramblings, I believe decentralized apps can be made much better, but the truth is, these companies don’t want them to be. A lot of them are making millions a month under a false sense of decentralization. 
Building apps fully on chain is incredibly hard, most aren’t going that far because they want to keep more control to themselves, giving us many single points of failure in the end.
I’m not sure how useful the technology will ultimately be many years from now. Currencies may take off more than the applications. 
Only time will tell…

# Our approach to indexing EVM events

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains have a neat way for off-chain services to learn about on-chain activity: events.
Hereunder, we explain what they are and how to index them using Rust, with `alloy` handling the heavy lifting of interacting with the node, and `tokio` facilitating parallelization.
## Introduction to Events
In Solidity, you can declare an event like this:
```
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```

and emit it with:
```
emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
```

You can emit events for anything you can imagine, like token transfers, price updates, permissions upgrades, etc. When something important happens on your contract, you emit an event.
From an EVM perspective, events are identified with `LOG0`, `LOG1`, `LOG2`, `LOG3`, and `LOG4` opcodes. They are all the same, and the subindex indicates the number of arguments you can index.
Indexing means that you can filter by any of the `indexed` fields. You can achieve the same result by indexing everything and then performing the filtering yourself, but that would waste a significant amount of resources. The EVM does it for you.
Our `Transfer` event will be using the opcode `LOG3`. That's why we have two indexed topics `from` and `to` and one extra for the event signature that we will explain later on.
As you can infer, you can index up to three topics, which would correspond to the `LOG4` opcode.
You may be wondering why events? Well, here's why:
  * They are very cheap to emit. In terms of gas. Way cheaper than writing to persistent storage.
  * They don't bloat the state trie, also known as the Patricia Merkle trie. This justifies why they are cheaper.
  * They use a [bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io), which allows high-speed queries when an event is not present.


## Fundamentals of event indexing
Any EVM-compatible node such as [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io) or [geth](https://blog.bilinearlabs.io/coming-soon/) comes with an RPC endpoint named `eth_getLogs`. The only parameters you need to provide to this call are:
  * The `address` of the contract. It can't be an EOA address, as that can't contain or execute code.
  * The `fromBlock` and `toBlock` range you want to search events in.
  * The so-called signature of the event, which is simply hashing the event name and type of each argument: `keccak256("Transfer(address,address,uint256)")`
  * The indexed events, if you want to apply a filter. You can use `null` if you don't want to apply any filters.


There is a great tool that's called `cast` that's part of [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io). It is a kind of Swiss army knife. It allows you to calculate the signature of any event.
```
cast keccak "Transfer(address,address,uint256)"
```

```

Putting it all together, we can get the `Transfer` events done between block `22361834` and `22362602` for the USDC contract, where the `to` was the zero address. This means burning them. Note that addresses shall be left-padded to 32 bytes. And note that the block numbers are provided in hexadecimal format.

## Indexing with Rust and Alloy
Now that we know the basics, let's see how to build a high-performing indexer to index a set of events of a given contract.
First and foremost, we recommend using [alloy](https://alloy.rs/?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io). It's a great library written in Rust that abstracts away deserialization, event signatures, types, and all the nitty-gritty so that we can focus on what's important. Last May 2025, they announced their [v1.0.0 release](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/05/introducing-alloy-v1-0?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io).
While `alloy` does a big part of the heavy lifting for us, there are other things we have to do, and we have to adapt to the use case:
  * Backfill events from contract deployment to the latest head.
  * Heavy parallelized requests.
  * Pick the block ranges `from` and `to` for each request.
  * Scale horizontally across multiple RPC endpoints.
  * Handle backpressure to prevent your memory from growing unbounded.
  * Order events for safer processing.
  * Use of middleware for failures and rate limits.
  * Batch inserts to allow faster processing.
  * Handle reorgs to safely index events in real time.
  * Polling vs subscription.


### Backfilling
Most of the time, indexing begins at the block where the contract was deployed. We refer to backfilling as the indexing of events that occurred in the past. Either because we just started the indexer, or because the indexer was offline for some time, so it has to catch up.
Ideally, you shall provide the deployment block, so you avoid indexing since the genesis block, which is block `0`. Since it uses a bloom filter, this indexing will be fast, but you can save some time.
### Parallelizing
The second important item is **parallelizing**. A commonly naive approach seen in indexing is running one request at a time. We request logs for blocks 0-999. When that finishes, from 1000-1999. When that finishes 2000-2999. That's very slow.
We rely on the [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io) Rust crate to spawn multiple requests simultaneously. Be aware that running too many parallel requests can cause your node to become overloaded, and its performance may even worsen.
### Block ranges
Then it's also essential to **choose the block range**. This is the number of blocks you ask for in every request. There is no rule of thumb, but more than 10,000 is definitely too much.
It's essential to understand your use case. It's not the same as indexing a contract that has tons of events as almost none. Using 1000 can be a good choice and will work well when there are numerous events, and will also move quickly when there are none.
There is an interesting approach here that uses a binary search. With this, you aim to fetch a given number of events in each range. If you are below that target, you increase the range. Opposite if you are above. However, we will save that for another post.
### Scale horizontally
To index events even faster, we can **scale horizontally**. This means using multiple RPC endpoints instead of a single one. With this, the bottleneck will be your downlink bandwidth and how fast you can process the events on your side.
There are numerous ways to schedule requests across all nodes. You can most likely write a PhD thesis with this, but a simple round robin goes a long way. Simple and effective.
### Handle backpressure
It's also essential to **handle backpressure** properly so that your node's memory doesn't grow unbounded. It will depend on your ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, so tune it accordingly. In most cases, event indexing resembles an ETL pipeline where events are:
  * Extracted from a source. The node, via a RPC endpoint.
  * Transformed. To calculate other derived fields, do some cleanup, etc.
  * Load. Store the resulting data in a database.


The Transform or Load stages can be slower than the Extract stage. In this case, you end up with more stuff coming in than going out. This can cause the memory of your node to increase exponentially.
Backpressure can be easily handled with a queue or buffer, where you only allow a maximum of `q` elements. When that's reached, the event indexing pauses briefly to enable the queue to be emptied.
### Order events
Parallelizing vertically and horizontally is excellent for fast indexing, but it has some associated problems. Each task can terminate in a different order, and **you must order the events accordingly**.
Let's see an example. You send two parallel requests:
  * `task1`. Get events for blocks 0-999:
  * `task2`. Get events for blocks 1000-1999


However `task2` can finalize before `task1` due to many reasons. And here we have multiple approaches. One is to write whatever finishes, no matter if it's in order.
The other approach is to wait for `task1` before processing `task2`. This allows to process the events in order, but you will be waiting for some time if requests come out of order. No approach is better. It depends on the use case.
### Middleware and retries
Using a **middleware** is also a great choice and [alloy](https://alloy.rs/?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io) comes with it. The most used one is a retrial middleware. Imagine one of your nodes goes offline. Your request will fail. If you don't have a retry mechanism, your indexer will crash. And this is an error that can most likely be recovered. This middleware sits between the node, "in the middle", and allows for the configuration of a retry logic.
For example, you can say that if a request fails, you want to retry up to 10 times with a given exponential backoff of a few seconds.
This retry logic is something you can implement yourself, but we highly recommend using an out-of-the-box middleware, such as `RetryBackoffLayer`.
### Batch inserts
Most likely, you will be inserting the events in some persistent storage. Depending on your use case, it's worth checking whether your database or the tool you're using allows for batch insertions.
This can speed up processing and improve performance by orders of magnitude. Inserting 1,000 events one by one is significantly slower than performing a batch insert of 1,000 events at once.
In some cases, you may need to "read your own writes" at the time of insertion. Meaning, inserting event 2 may have some dependency on event 1. If so, make sure that batch inserting allows you to read your writes. If it doesn't, you won't be able to read until you commit the batch.
### Handle reorgs
There are also **reorgs** , something that is the root cause of many bugs. A reorg occurs when your node’s fork‑choice rule switches its view of the canonical chain to a different branch. In practice, this means it discards previously accepted blocks and adopts a new fork that the protocol considers heavier. Each consensus has its own rule. PoW uses the longest chain, and PoS the one with the most stake on it.
This means that you could index an event from a block that later on is reorged. And maybe after the reorg that event is not there anymore. So your indexer is wrong! It indexed something that never happened!
Depending on the use case, various approaches can be employed to solve this problem. If you genuinely need real-time indexing, staying up to date with the latest head, you shall handle reorgs. Most nodes will notify you about this.
You can also check that the new block you receive always matches the previous `newHead.parentHash` matches `lastHead.hash`
Another approach is to index a few blocks behind the head, like 2 or 3. With that, you have a 30-second delay. You will still have reorgs, but the chances are way lower.
The last approach is to only index finalized blocks. This means having a delay of around 13 minutes from the head. With this, you have a very very very high guarantee that no reorg will happen. So your indexer will be fine.
### Pooling vs Subscription
Last but not least, when it comes to indexing, there are two common approaches on how to stay up to date with the chain:
  * Pooling-based. You keep asking the blockchain every `x` second if there is a new block. If there is, you fetch it.
  * Subscription-based. You subscribe to new blocks, often using websockets. The moment a new block is added, you are notified immediately.


Each approach has pros and cons. With pooling, you won't be notified exactly when a new block is available; you will have a worst-case delay of `x`. Whereas with subscription-based, you are notified immediately.
But the subscription-based model has some cons. The connection may be dropped, or you may experience a brief period of being offline. In which you won't be getting blocks. Be very careful and constantly monitor that the next block is always the previous +1. With this, you catch a bunch of bugs and ensure you are not missing blocks.
So the best approach is a mix of both. Rely on subscriptions for getting the latest block, but always have pooling as a backup plan.
## Case Study: Indexing Ethereum Deposit Contract
Here is an example of how we tackle indexing. We use Rust for performance, `alloy` to easily interact with the node and `tokio` to massively parallelize requests.
[ GitHub - BilinearLabs/beacon-contract-indexer: Indexes Ethereum’s Beacon Deposit Contract Indexes Ethereum’s Beacon Deposit Contract. Contribute to BilinearLabs/beacon-contract-indexer development by creating an account on GitHub. ![](https://blog.bilinearlabs.io/content/images/icon/pinned-octocat-093da3e6fa40.svg)GitHubBilinearLabs ![](https://blog.bilinearlabs.io/content/images/thumbnail/beacon-contract-indexer)](https://github.com/BilinearLabs/beacon-contract-indexer/?ref=blog.bilinearlabs.io)
In this example we index the Ethereum deposit contract, processing around 40k blocks per second in mainnet.
We use a producer-consumer architecture, where the producer continuously spawns new tasks that hit the RPC node. We define a maximum number of concurrent requests to prevent the node from being overwhelmed.
To handle backpressure, we define a maximum queue size. When full, the producer stops generating more events until a slot becomes available. This is a safety measure to prevent memory from growing without bounds, but it would be a rare event since events are consumed at a faster rate.
For this use case, we wanted to process blocks in order, so the consumer stores the blocks in a key-value buffer. When the next block range becomes available, it's pulled from the buffer and processed.
